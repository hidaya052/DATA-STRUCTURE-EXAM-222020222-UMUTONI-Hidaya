int age = 20; → Declares an integer variable and assigns it the value 20.
double price = 19.99; → Declares a floating-point number for storing decimal values.
char grade = 'A'; → Stores a single character.
string name = "Alice"; → Stores a sequence of characters (a string).
cout << is used to print text to the console.
endl moves to the next line.Replaced cin >> hidaya; with cin >> name;

'hidaya' was not a declared variable; we needed to use name.
Replaced cin >> 22; with cin >> age;
We cannot input a fixed number like 22 directly; instead, we store user input in age.

Function Definition (int add(int a, int b)) → This function takes two integer parameters and returns their sum.
Function Call (add(5, 10)) → Calls the function with 5 and 10 as arguments.
Return Statement (return a + b;) → The function computes and returns the sum.
Variable sum stores the result (sum = add(5, 10);).
Output is displayed using cout.

Uses if-else to check if a number is divisible by 2.
cin >> number; → Takes user input.
number % 2 == 0 → Checks if the remainder is 0 (even number).
Outputs "even" or "odd" based on the result.

Declares an array (int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};).
Loops through each element using a for loop (for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)).
Prints each value using cout << numbers[i].

Uses functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Switch-case handles user choice.
Prevents division by zero using an if statement.

<iostream> is a standard C++ library that allows input and output operations.
It enables the use of cin (for input) and cout (for output).
Without including <iostream>, we cannot use cout or cin, and the program won’t compile.

Without including <iostream>, we cannot use cout or cin, and the program won’t compile.

Feature	Description	Example Usage
<iostream>	Enables input (cin) and output (cout) operations	#include <iostream>
return 0;	Indicates successful program execution	return 0;
cout	Outputs text, numbers, or variables to the console	cout << "Hello!";
