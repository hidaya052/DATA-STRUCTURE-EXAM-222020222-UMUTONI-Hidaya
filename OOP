int age = 20; → Declares an integer variable and assigns it the value 20.
double price = 19.99; → Declares a floating-point number for storing decimal values.
char grade = 'A'; → Stores a single character.
string name = "Alice"; → Stores a sequence of characters (a string).
cout << is used to print text to the console.
endl moves to the next line.Replaced cin >> hidaya; with cin >> name;

'hidaya' was not a declared variable; we needed to use name.
Replaced cin >> 22; with cin >> age;
We cannot input a fixed number like 22 directly; instead, we store user input in age.

Function Definition (int add(int a, int b)) → This function takes two integer parameters and returns their sum.
Function Call (add(5, 10)) → Calls the function with 5 and 10 as arguments.
Return Statement (return a + b;) → The function computes and returns the sum

<iostream> is a standard C++ library that allows input and output operations.
It enables the use of cin (for input) and cout (for output).
Without including <iostream>, we cannot use cout or cin, and the program won’t compile.

Without including <iostream>, we cannot use cout or cin, and the program won’t compile.

Feature	Description	Example Usage
<iostream>	Enables input (cin) and output (cout) operations	#include <iostream>
return 0;	Indicates successful program execution	return 0;
cout	Outputs text, numbers, or variables to the console	cout << "Hello!";
